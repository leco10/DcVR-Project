# DcVR-Project
This project aims to create a VR sytsem for D. cerebrum.<br>
This repository includes programs for tracking the tail, estimating velocities (Estimator) and rendering a 3D virtual environment (Generator).
- The Estimator consists of a GUI, a script and the estimator function, all written in Matlab.
- The Generator is demonstrated by the 2D OMR experiment protocol written in Python, which renders the virtual environment and updates it according to received velocities and the experimental paradigm.
