# DcVR-Project
This project aims to create a VR sytsem for D. cerebrum.
This repository includes programs for tracking the tail, estimating velocities (Estimator) and rendering a 3D virtual environment (Generator).
The Estimator consists of a GUI, a script and the estimator function, all written in Matlab.
The Generator is demonstrated by the 2D OMR experiment protocol, which renders the virtual environment and updates it according to received velocities and the experimental paradigm.
